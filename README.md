# queer-s-memory
An incredible project with I try to help to the lgbt community of my university 
to share what they were doing and thinking.

In this website, I design a slider with the colective's proposal (images that 
are just text) to give information to the visitors about the objectives's project 
since the first moment in the index cover.

I used a lot of images, videos and audios that they provided me, with all 
this content I turn on the creative mode and create 6 different tabs, each
one of these tab have a lot of information about what does they do, think 
and their experiences.

My friend Oscar helped to me to create a contact form.

Finaly, I learned that if you need to work with to much content 
like images and text, compress images it is required, this project it is 
super large but I know that if I summarize the text and compress the images 
changing .JPG images for .WEBP the charge speed it will increase amazingly
